# Time-Series-Homework
The main task in this challenge is to use time-series to organize and analyze stock and trend data.

### Organization
The relavent python notebooks is titled `forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb`
The code was run on Google Colab, and can be viewed at: `https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UPYfOYPBmGXUT4tJlKfBiYLfnbJR3lMb#scrollTo=_-MrtQHnIqck`

### Code and Dependencies
